At 2 Hour Learning, we're not content to merely adopt AI—we've encoded it into our DNA. We've re-engineered the learning experience from the ground up, harnessing AI and learning science breakthroughs to shatter the confines of the traditional school day. The result? Students who don't just meet the bar—they vault over it.
The proof of our approach is undeniable: students using our platform consistently achieve 4s and 5s on five or more AP exams, demonstrate more than two years' growth on yearly MAP assessments, and shatter their own expectations of what they can achieve. If you're energized by the opportunity to deliver transformative results at an unprecedented scale, 2 Hour Learning is where you belong.
You'll serve as the chief architect behind our revolutionary learning ecosystem for your dedicated school model, which spans multiple campuses.

Your role will be a perfect blend of data-driven strategy and hands-on engagement. You'll dive deep into learning analytics, uncovering key insights to drive exponential growth. But you won't just crunch numbers from afar—you'll be on the front lines, working directly with students to understand their experiences, challenges, and triumphs. This firsthand knowledge will be invaluable as you pinpoint the specific motivational levers and pedagogical strategies to shatter achievement ceilings across all campuses.
You'll empower a dynamic team of learning engineers, data scientists, and instructional innovators to bring your vision to life.
