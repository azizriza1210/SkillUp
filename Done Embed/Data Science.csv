Job Overview

We are currently seeking Developers for project-specific roles focused on RLHF. This role will play a key part in our reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) initiatives, contributing to cutting-edge projects.

You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for for the worlds most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the biggest players in the AI/LLM space today. We are seeking software engineers with 4+ years of experience to train AI large language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!

What Will I Be Doing?

Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""

Contract Length

Interview Process

We've created a 3.5 hour screening and onboarding process to join as a Software Engineer for AI Training Data which can be accomplished in 1 week or less. We purposely perform most of these steps asynchronously because most of the RLHF work is async and self guided. After you apply, if you look like a good fit we'll provide you access to the G2i dashboard to go through this simple screening process.

Step 1: Learn in depth about the role (35 min)

Step 2: Perform a simple RLHF code review (35 min)

Step 3: Receive platform credentials, pass ID verification (5 min), and choose your project (30 min).

We have everything from ""which piece of Swift code is better?"" to ""make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterwards to make it faster""
