We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making.

We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We’ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge.

What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

Deliver results. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.

Agoda,Engineering Manager – Machine Learning and Data Engineering (Bangkok based),1 week ago,"About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

 Our Purpose –  Bridging the World Through Travel 

We believe travel allows people to enjoy, learn and experience more of the amazing world we live in. It brings individuals and cultures closer together, fostering empathy, understanding and happiness.

We are a skillful, driven and diverse team from across the globe, united by a passion to make an impact. Harnessing our innovative technologies and strong partnerships, we aim to make travel easy and rewarding for everyone.

Get to Know our Team:

The Data department oversees all of Agoda’s data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.

The Opportunity:

We are looking for top notch development managers to lead the teams of our data services. We use big data and ML for most of our applications – fraud, recommendation, marketing, ranking, supply management and many more. Each of these bring their own challenges of combining a distributed, multi-dc, scalable and performant solution with the needs of modern cutting-edge algorithms (such as deep learning).

You will manage a team of engineers in joint scrums with the best data scientists around to achieve these goals and since Agoda is the fastest growing travel company in the world you can imagine the challenges of tomorrow will be even more demanding.

Our ideal candidates are experienced agile development managers who master technology to the point where you can make a trade off and decide when to use which technology, and push our platform forward. At the same time, also have solid agile experience to deliver at rapid pace.

We believe that managers should be professionals at technology, should be able to jump into any project and understand the bits & bolts of the technologies their teams use. If you are one of those people that don’t want to “just manage” and still excited about building things along with building teams, you will fit here very well.

In this Role, you’ll get to:

Lead team of at 6 – 12 energetic developers 
Drive design and architecture of the system 
Create a robust, scalable and blazing-fast API. 
Drive the execution of the team toward the vision. Visionary and pragmatic. 
Grow and coach team members. Always challenge team to be higher performer. 
Work closely with product owner to provide technical direction 
Be able to work with data scientists, understand and contribute to modern machine learning development lifecycle 

Technologies we love

Big Data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Impala) 
Machine learning technologies (E.g. Python scikit, SparkML, Tensorflow) 
Micro-services development languages & technologies (E.g.: Java, Scala/Akka, Python/Django/flask) 
Relational database (E.g.: SQL Server, Postgres) 
NoSQL database technologies (E.g.: Cassandra, Couchbase, Aerospike) 
Message queueing technologies (E.g.: Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, MSMQ) 
Continuous Integration (Jenkins / Teamcity) 
Performance and load testing 

What you’ll Need to Succeed:

Passionate about technology and building software 
5-10 years’ experience in software development and a mix of the above mentioned technologies. 
At least 3 years’ experience in a leadership/influencer position: team lead, development manager or architect. 
Must have worked in an Agile environment and understands Scrum 

It’s Great if You Have:

Familiarity with travel industry and rate system is a plus 
Experience in ML development is a plus
