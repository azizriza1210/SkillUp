Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation.

Lead team of at 6 – 12 energetic developers 
Drive design and architecture of the system 
Create a robust, scalable and blazing-fast API.

Grow and coach team members. Always challenge team to be higher performer.

5-10 years’ experience in software development and a mix of the above mentioned technologies. 
At least 3 years’ experience in a leadership/influencer position: team lead, development manager or architect. 
Must have worked in an Agile environment and understands Scrum 

It’s Great if You Have:

Familiarity with travel industry and rate system is a plus
