Management Sciences for Health (MSH),Data Assistant Consultant,Posted 30+ days ago,"Indonesia has achieved a remarkable increase in drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) notification in 2022 and 2023 after a significant drop in 2020-/2021 due to COVID. In 2023, the country has notified the highest ever number of patients with DSTB - 821,200 persons (77% of incidents) – 1077% increase compared to pre-COVID notifications (tbdiah.org). However, during the same year, almost 100,000 notified patients didn’t initiate treatment, or their treatment status is not known due to different reasons.
The DS-TB treatment gap is not a new phenomenon. The magnitude however is evolving, e.g., the gap was 8% in 2021 but became 12% in 2023. Only 79% of patients from private physicians, 82% from private clinics, 89% in government clinics, 87% in private hospitals, 86% in public hospitals, and 92% patients in Puskesmas were enrolled in DS-TB treatment in 2023. People diagnosed with TB who are not treated may develop worsen conditions and continue transmission to their household and close contacts.
Indonesia has strengthened public-private mix strategy in TB program implementation, which enabled referrals between healthcare facilities particularly for those with limited diagnostic tools availability and capacity to provide treatment to nearest DOTS facilities that provide quality and standardized care. Unfortunately, even with successful referral for accurate diagnosis, not all people with TB initiated treatment. The main objectives is are to find out what are the causes for the gaps; why, where and when they are happening.
While improving TB screening, diagnosis and notification are critical steps, ensuring everyone diagnosed receives appropriate and timely treatment is very important. The gap between notification and treatment could arise due to different reasons in service delivery, access and barriers to care, and issues in the health systems including sources, quality and completeness of data. An assessment to better understand the root causes and mitigating them would be urgently needed. Therefore, this assessment aims to examine the process, barriers, and good practices in treatment initiation including the vertical and horizontal referrals between healthcare facilities.
The assessment approach could be streamlined balancing scientific rigor and pragmatic and time needed.
The assessment would use both qualitative and quantitative approaches. These include desk reviews at the beginning of the assessment, development of a data collection tool/questionnaires, plan for data collection including site visits and data analysis.
Description of works and responsibilities of the Assistant Consultant :
1. Work in close collaboration with Public Health Expert to ensure all the tasks for DS-TB enrolment gap assessment are done on time
2. Collect and process TB data related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment
3. Provide clean TB data for further analysis result by consultant team (public health expert and data analyst) in order to develop desk review report.
4. Prepare and support the administration task needed by the consultant team, such as drafting letter, Minutes of Meeting, travel request, schedule and coordinate meetings and data collection schedules.
5. Participate in meetings and regular communication with NTP and USAID-BEBAS TB

Management Sciences for Health (MSH),Public Health expert,Posted 30+ days ago,"Indonesia has achieved a remarkable increase in drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) notification in 2022 and 2023 after a significant drop in 2020-/2021 due to COVID. In 2023, the country has notified the highest ever number of patients with DSTB - 821,200 persons (77% of incidents) – 1077% increase compared to pre-COVID notifications (tbdiah.org). However, during the same year, almost 100,000 notified patients didn’t initiate treatment, or their treatment status is not known due to different reasons.
The DS-TB treatment gap is not a new phenomenon. The magnitude however is evolving, e.g., the gap was 8% in 2021 but became 12% in 2023. Only 79% of patients from private physicians, 82% from private clinics, 89% in government clinics, 87% in private hospitals, 86% in public hospitals, and 92% patients in Puskesmas were enrolled in DS-TB treatment in 2023. People diagnosed with TB who are not treated may develop worsen conditions and continue transmission to their household and close contacts.
Indonesia has strengthened public-private mix strategy in TB program implementation, which enabled referrals between healthcare facilities particularly for those with limited diagnostic tools availability and capacity to provide treatment to nearest DOTS facilities that provide quality and standardized care. Unfortunately, even with successful referral for accurate diagnosis, not all people with TB initiated treatment. The main objectives is are to find out what are the causes for the gaps; why, where and when they are happening.
While improving TB screening, diagnosis and notification are critical steps, ensuring everyone diagnosed receives appropriate and timely treatment is very important. The gap between notification and treatment could arise due to different reasons in service delivery, access and barriers to care, and issues in the health systems including sources, quality and completeness of data. An assessment to better understand the root causes and mitigating them would be urgently needed. Therefore, this assessment aims to examine the process, barriers, and good practices in treatment initiation including the vertical and horizontal referrals between healthcare facilities.
The assessment approach could be streamlined balancing scientific rigor and pragmatic and time needed.
The assessment would use both qualitative and quantitative approaches. These include desk reviews at the beginning of the assessment, development of a data collection tool/questionnaires, plan for data collection including site visits and data analysis.
Description of works and responsibilities of the consultant:
Work in close collaboration with Data Analyst to ensure all the tasks for DS-TB enrolment gap assessment are done on time
Liaison with NTP and related partners to ensure the implementation of activities related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment, esp. the stakeholders meeting, field visit, key informant interviews
Support the coordination with NTP for the administrative issues related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment activities Review and provide feedbacks for the data analysis, and reports developed by data analyst
Participate in meetings and regular communication with NTP and USAID-BEBAS TB
QUALIFICATIONS
Required Education:

Tetra Tech,Junior Credit Analyst (Independent Consultancy) - Indonesia,Posted 30+ days ago,"Tetra Tech provides best-in-class energy consulting services for clients worldwide. Our work advances clean energy to achieve climate and decarbonization goals; creates sustainable utilities and modern grids; and promotes gender equality and economic inclusivity at the energy nexus.
Tetra Tech was awarded the USAID Sustainable Energy for Indonesia's Advancing Resilience (SINAR) project from January 2021 to January 2026. SINAR seeks to advance Indonesia's development goals in expanding reliable and equitable energy services necessary for sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. To achieve this goal, SINAR will focus on the following areas: 1) Accelerating deployment of advanced energy technologies, 2) Improving performance of energy utilities, 3) Applying procurement best practices, and 4) Establishing an institutional framework and capacity for energy sector transformation.
By achieving this goal, USAID will contribute to Indonesia’s Sustainable Development Goals and 2020-2024 National Medium Term Development Plan.

Task Description
To fulfill its commitment to sustainable development and green financing, the Government of Indonesia launched the Indonesia Environment Fund (IEF/BPDLH) through Minister of Finance Regulation No. 137/2019 in October 2019. BPDLH has the aim of increasing the level of green finance in Indonesia and will be the official mechanism for managing and coordinating environmental and climate funds including from international sources.
Indonesia's forests play a multifaceted role in advancing the country's renewable energy agenda, offering opportunities for sustainable energy production, carbon sequestration, and economic development. Forested areas contribute to the preservation of watersheds and rivers, which are essential for hydropower generation. Indonesia has significant hydropower potential, and maintaining forest cover helps ensure consistent water flow for hydropower plants, contributing to a more diversified renewable energy mix. The Research, Development and Innovation Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has so far built 31 micro-hydro units which have benefited 1,731 families in 28 villages around forest areas.
Geothermal energy is another renewable energy source that intersects with forest ecosystems. Indonesia has approximately 14,961 MW of geothermal potential with 12,705 MW located in conservation areas across 18 provinces. Therefore, balancing geothermal development with forest conservation is essential to achieve sustainable energy production while safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the rights of local communities. Also, integrating environmental and social considerations into project planning and implementation is key to achieving a harmonious relationship between geothermal energy and forest ecosystems.
One of the programs owned by BPDLH is Revolving Fund Facility (Fasilitas Dana Bergulir/FDB). FDB is designed to provide access to capital for forestry business development and environmental investment in the context of forest conservation carried out by members of the Forestry Business Group who have direct access to forest management and environmental conservation activities. The Reforestation Fund (Dana Reboisasi) is one of the funds managed through the provision of FDB. This fund is intended to support forest and land restoration through rehabilitation and sustainable forest management efforts, with a focus on empowering forest-dependent communities in accordance with the mandate of Presidential Regulation 23/2021 on Forest Management Implementation.
USAID SINAR aims to support BPDLH in achieving the fund distribution target and enhance the accountability of providing FDB to the community. The Junior Credit Analyst will support USAID SINAR in delivering the technical assistance to BPDLH.

Tetra Tech,Senior Credit Analyst (Independent Consultancy) - Indonesia,Posted 30+ days ago,"Tetra Tech provides best-in-class energy consulting services for clients worldwide. Our work advances clean energy to achieve climate and decarbonization goals; creates sustainable utilities and modern grids; and promotes gender equality and economic inclusivity at the energy nexus.
Tetra Tech was awarded the USAID Sustainable Energy for Indonesia's Advancing Resilience (SINAR) project from January 2021 to January 2026. SINAR seeks to advance Indonesia's development goals in expanding reliable and equitable energy services necessary for sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. To achieve this goal, SINAR will focus on the following areas: 1) Accelerating deployment of advanced energy technologies, 2) Improving performance of energy utilities, 3) Applying procurement best practices, and 4) Establishing an institutional framework and capacity for energy sector transformation.
By achieving this goal, USAID will contribute to Indonesia’s Sustainable Development Goals and 2020-2024 National Medium Term Development Plan.

Task Description
To fulfill its commitment to sustainable development and green financing, the Government of Indonesia launched the Indonesia Environment Fund (IEF/BPDLH) through Minister of Finance Regulation No. 137/2019 in October 2019. BPDLH has the aim of increasing the level of green finance in Indonesia and will be the official mechanism for managing and coordinating environmental and climate funds including from international sources.
Indonesia's forests play a multifaceted role in advancing the country's renewable energy agenda, offering opportunities for sustainable energy production, carbon sequestration, and economic development. Forested areas contribute to the preservation of watersheds and rivers, which are essential for hydropower generation. Indonesia has significant hydropower potential, and maintaining forest cover helps ensure consistent water flow for hydropower plants, contributing to a more diversified renewable energy mix. The Research, Development and Innovation Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has so far built 31 micro-hydro units which have benefited 1,731 families in 28 villages around forest areas.
Geothermal energy is another renewable energy source that intersects with forest ecosystems. Indonesia has approximately 14,961 MW of geothermal potential with 12,705 MW located in conservation areas across 18 provinces. Therefore, balancing geothermal development with forest conservation is essential to achieve sustainable energy production while safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the rights of local communities. Also, integrating environmental and social considerations into project planning and implementation is key to achieving a harmonious relationship between geothermal energy and forest ecosystems.
One of the programs owned by BPDLH is Revolving Fund Facility (Fasilitas Dana Bergulir/FDB). FDB is designed to provide access to capital for forestry business development and environmental investment in the context of forest conservation carried out by members of the Forestry Business Group who have direct access to forest management and environmental conservation activities. The Reforestation Fund (Dana Reboisasi) is one of the funds managed through the provision of FDB. This fund is intended to support forest and land restoration through rehabilitation and sustainable forest management efforts, with a focus on empowering forest-dependent communities in accordance with the mandate of Presidential Regulation 23/2021 on Forest Management Implementation.
USAID SINAR aims to support BPDLH in achieving the fund distribution target and enhance the accountability of providing FDB to the community. The Senior Credit Analyst will support USAID SINAR in delivering the technical assistance to BPDLH.
Position summary & job purpose
USAID SINAR is currently accepting applications for Senior Credit Analyst for a short-term technical assignment (STTA). The assignment has a length of effort (LOE) of up to two hundred forty (240) days, estimated for one year period. The analyst will provide support to USAID SINAR activities under sustainable finance team. The successful candidate is expected to have knowledge and technical skills defined in the section below.
