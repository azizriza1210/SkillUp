Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements

Management Sciences for Health (MSH),Data Assistant Consultant,Posted 30+ days ago,"Indonesia has achieved a remarkable increase in drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) notification in 2022 and 2023 after a significant drop in 2020-/2021 due to COVID. In 2023, the country has notified the highest ever number of patients with DSTB - 821,200 persons (77% of incidents) – 1077% increase compared to pre-COVID notifications (tbdiah.org). However, during the same year, almost 100,000 notified patients didn’t initiate treatment, or their treatment status is not known due to different reasons.
The DS-TB treatment gap is not a new phenomenon. The magnitude however is evolving, e.g., the gap was 8% in 2021 but became 12% in 2023. Only 79% of patients from private physicians, 82% from private clinics, 89% in government clinics, 87% in private hospitals, 86% in public hospitals, and 92% patients in Puskesmas were enrolled in DS-TB treatment in 2023. People diagnosed with TB who are not treated may develop worsen conditions and continue transmission to their household and close contacts.
Indonesia has strengthened public-private mix strategy in TB program implementation, which enabled referrals between healthcare facilities particularly for those with limited diagnostic tools availability and capacity to provide treatment to nearest DOTS facilities that provide quality and standardized care. Unfortunately, even with successful referral for accurate diagnosis, not all people with TB initiated treatment. The main objectives is are to find out what are the causes for the gaps; why, where and when they are happening.
While improving TB screening, diagnosis and notification are critical steps, ensuring everyone diagnosed receives appropriate and timely treatment is very important. The gap between notification and treatment could arise due to different reasons in service delivery, access and barriers to care, and issues in the health systems including sources, quality and completeness of data. An assessment to better understand the root causes and mitigating them would be urgently needed. Therefore, this assessment aims to examine the process, barriers, and good practices in treatment initiation including the vertical and horizontal referrals between healthcare facilities.
The assessment approach could be streamlined balancing scientific rigor and pragmatic and time needed.
The assessment would use both qualitative and quantitative approaches. These include desk reviews at the beginning of the assessment, development of a data collection tool/questionnaires, plan for data collection including site visits and data analysis.
Description of works and responsibilities of the Assistant Consultant :
1. Work in close collaboration with Public Health Expert to ensure all the tasks for DS-TB enrolment gap assessment are done on time
2. Collect and process TB data related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment
3. Provide clean TB data for further analysis result by consultant team (public health expert and data analyst) in order to develop desk review report.

Indonesia has demonstrated its preparedness in rolling-out COVID19 vaccination program and take an active global role from there. At that time, the Ministry of Health (MoH) adopt “One Health Data” approach in monitoring and digitizing the vaccination process by working synergistically with the Ministry of Communication and Information in registration phase (PEDULI LINDUNGI system), UNDP in supply-chain management of vaccines and related logistics (SMILE system) as well as with BPJS/the National Social Security Body in individual registry of vaccinated people (P-CARE system). As per 01 February 2023, the MoH has been managing data of COVID19 vaccine distribution of 454,4 million doses from provincial level down to 12,000 health facilities. Given the significant achievements from COVID19 vaccination, Directorate of Immunization built similar integrated approach for routine immunization by synergizing SMILE system (Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi dan Logistik Elektronik) and ASIK (Aplikasi Sehat Indonesiaku) system (a P-CARE mirroring system, but now developed by the MoH).

Management Sciences for Health (MSH),Public Health expert,Posted 30+ days ago,"Indonesia has achieved a remarkable increase in drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) notification in 2022 and 2023 after a significant drop in 2020-/2021 due to COVID. In 2023, the country has notified the highest ever number of patients with DSTB - 821,200 persons (77% of incidents) – 1077% increase compared to pre-COVID notifications (tbdiah.org). However, during the same year, almost 100,000 notified patients didn’t initiate treatment, or their treatment status is not known due to different reasons.
The DS-TB treatment gap is not a new phenomenon. The magnitude however is evolving, e.g., the gap was 8% in 2021 but became 12% in 2023. Only 79% of patients from private physicians, 82% from private clinics, 89% in government clinics, 87% in private hospitals, 86% in public hospitals, and 92% patients in Puskesmas were enrolled in DS-TB treatment in 2023. People diagnosed with TB who are not treated may develop worsen conditions and continue transmission to their household and close contacts.
Indonesia has strengthened public-private mix strategy in TB program implementation, which enabled referrals between healthcare facilities particularly for those with limited diagnostic tools availability and capacity to provide treatment to nearest DOTS facilities that provide quality and standardized care. Unfortunately, even with successful referral for accurate diagnosis, not all people with TB initiated treatment. The main objectives is are to find out what are the causes for the gaps; why, where and when they are happening.
While improving TB screening, diagnosis and notification are critical steps, ensuring everyone diagnosed receives appropriate and timely treatment is very important. The gap between notification and treatment could arise due to different reasons in service delivery, access and barriers to care, and issues in the health systems including sources, quality and completeness of data. An assessment to better understand the root causes and mitigating them would be urgently needed. Therefore, this assessment aims to examine the process, barriers, and good practices in treatment initiation including the vertical and horizontal referrals between healthcare facilities.
The assessment approach could be streamlined balancing scientific rigor and pragmatic and time needed.
The assessment would use both qualitative and quantitative approaches. These include desk reviews at the beginning of the assessment, development of a data collection tool/questionnaires, plan for data collection including site visits and data analysis.
Description of works and responsibilities of the consultant:
Work in close collaboration with Data Analyst to ensure all the tasks for DS-TB enrolment gap assessment are done on time
Liaison with NTP and related partners to ensure the implementation of activities related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment, esp. the stakeholders meeting, field visit, key informant interviews
Support the coordination with NTP for the administrative issues related to DS-TB enrolment gap assessment activities Review and provide feedbacks for the data analysis, and reports developed by data analyst
Participate in meetings and regular communication with NTP and USAID-BEBAS TB
QUALIFICATIONS
Required Education:
Doctorate or master’s degree in public health, epidemiology, health policy, or a related field
Experience:
Extensive experience (at least 7-10 years) in TB control programs, including experience in leading or managing similar assessments or projects

At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
