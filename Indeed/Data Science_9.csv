What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
