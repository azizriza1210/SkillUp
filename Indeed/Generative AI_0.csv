Crossover,"Lead Software Architect, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $200,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a seasoned software engineer with a deep interest in AI? Trilogy is on the lookout for exceptional engineers to lead the charge in adopting generative AI tools both in our development process and into our products.
Join us to work on our exciting product portfolio:
TeachTap: Bringing historical figures to life using AI, offering an engaging, TikTok-like learning experience to make learning more relevant and fun.
Educational Content Generation: Utilizing the latest in generative AI combined with comprehensive learning materials to create captivating content.
TeachTower: A game-based motivation system inspired by popular games like Roblox and Minecraft, designed to make learning irresistibly fun.
Coachbot: A learning copilot that integrates with existing apps, guiding learning paths, recommending next steps, and rewarding daily progress.
Your role will focus on integrating AI into engineering practices, using AI tools to increase efficiency and solve engineering tasks like coding and testing. Based on the obtained results, you will derive recipes and playbooks to be adopted by the broader engineering team. Maintaining high-quality standards in our codebases while ensuring high leverage of AI tools across our engineering teams will be a key part of your work.
You will be an integral part of our existing engineering team, working collaboratively on our suite of products to deeply understand our environment and needs. You will have the freedom to propose and experiment with new tools and then will leverage the insights and experiences obtained to evolve our processes, advocate for new tool adoption, or even spearhead the creation of small tools, bots, and frameworks to enhance our technical setup.
We seek candidates with a strong background in software engineering and a capacity for adapting to new technologies. Moreover, an interest in the latest generative AI developments and a drive for innovation are crucial. While our primary tech stack is AWS Serverless with TypeScript, we're looking for versatile engineers who can excel in a variety of technical environments and challenges.

What you will be doing
Developing fully functional features, using AI tools to expedite delivery and enhance quality.
Performing experiments with AI to enhance engineering processes, including decomposition, solution design, code generation, and troubleshooting.
Documenting best practices and techniques in guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.

What you will NOT be doing
Building new AI models from scratch; instead, your focus will be on leveraging and fine-tuning existing models to maximize efficiency.
Being confined to outdated technologies; we encourage an environment that thrives on dynamic tech stacks, fostering continuous innovation.

Key Responsibilities
Drive transformative change by establishing a framework that seamlessly integrates generative AI, significantly amplifying engineering productivity.

Candidate Requirements
Minimum 5 years of experience in professional software development.
Minimum 3 years either as a lead engineer reviewing the work of other engineers or as an architect making important technical decisions.

Join us at LearnWith.AI as we integrate AI into learning, creating cutting-edge educational experiences. We're seeking a Unity developer with outstanding engineering skills to implement games that push the boundaries of educational technology.
Your role will be pivotal in developing Magic Academy—a game where knowledge isn't just taught, it's experienced. You'll be responsible for creating sophisticated metaphors that visualize students' knowledge, turning abstract information into tangible, interactive experiences. This isn't just about identifying gaps in learning; it's about building robust, scalable solutions that create immersive learning adventures.
What we offer:
The chance to work with cutting-edge technologies in education and game development,
A platform to showcase your engineering prowess, directly impacting how students learn,
A dynamic environment where technical innovation is not just encouraged but required.
We're looking for engineers who can deliver solutions at the highest level of quality.
