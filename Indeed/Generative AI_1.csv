At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

At 2 Hour Learning, we're on a mission to flip the script on traditional education. Our academic ecosystem, powered by cutting-edge AI and learning science, is already enabling students to shatter learning goals in a fraction of the time. But we're just getting started.
You'll be the catalyst that takes our AI-driven products to new heights of engagement and efficacy. This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.
You'll also flex your leadership chops, guiding outsourced dev teams to execute on your vision and quality standards. It's full ownership, full accountability, and full potential to make a seismic impact on education.

Crossover,"Senior Software Architect, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $200,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a seasoned software engineer with a deep interest in AI? Trilogy is on the lookout for exceptional engineers to lead the charge in adopting generative AI tools both in our development process and into our products.
Join us to work on our exciting product portfolio:
TeachTap: Bringing historical figures to life using AI, offering an engaging, TikTok-like learning experience to make learning more relevant and fun.
Educational Content Generation: Utilizing the latest in generative AI combined with comprehensive learning materials to create captivating content.
TeachTower: A game-based motivation system inspired by popular games like Roblox and Minecraft, designed to make learning irresistibly fun.
Coachbot: A learning copilot that integrates with existing apps, guiding learning paths, recommending next steps, and rewarding daily progress.
Your role will focus on integrating AI into engineering practices, using AI tools to increase efficiency and solve engineering tasks like coding and testing. Based on the obtained results, you will derive recipes and playbooks to be adopted by the broader engineering team. Maintaining high-quality standards in our codebases while ensuring high leverage of AI tools across our engineering teams will be a key part of your work.
You will be an integral part of our existing engineering team, working collaboratively on our suite of products to deeply understand our environment and needs. You will have the freedom to propose and experiment with new tools and then will leverage the insights and experiences obtained to evolve our processes, advocate for new tool adoption, or even spearhead the creation of small tools, bots, and frameworks to enhance our technical setup.
We seek candidates with a strong background in software engineering and a capacity for adapting to new technologies. Moreover, an interest in the latest generative AI developments and a drive for innovation are crucial. While our primary tech stack is AWS Serverless with TypeScript, we're looking for versatile engineers who can excel in a variety of technical environments and challenges.

What you will be doing
Developing fully functional features, using AI tools to expedite delivery and enhance quality.
Performing experiments with AI to enhance engineering processes, including decomposition, solution design, code generation, and troubleshooting.
Documenting best practices and techniques in guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.

What you will NOT be doing
Building new AI models from scratch; instead, your focus will be on leveraging and fine-tuning existing models to maximize efficiency.
Being confined to outdated technologies; we encourage an environment that thrives on dynamic tech stacks, fostering continuous innovation.

Key Responsibilities
Drive transformative change by establishing a framework that seamlessly integrates generative AI, significantly amplifying engineering productivity.

Candidate Requirements
Minimum 5 years of experience in professional software development.
Minimum 3 years either as a lead engineer reviewing the work of other engineers or as an architect making important technical decisions.
