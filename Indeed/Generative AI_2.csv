At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

At 2 Hour Learning, we're on a mission to flip the script on traditional education. Our academic ecosystem, powered by cutting-edge AI and learning science, is already enabling students to shatter learning goals in a fraction of the time. But we're just getting started.
You'll be the catalyst that takes our AI-driven products to new heights of engagement and efficacy. This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.
You'll also flex your leadership chops, guiding outsourced dev teams to execute on your vision and quality standards. It's full ownership, full accountability, and full potential to make a seismic impact on education.

Crossover,"Senior Director of Product Management, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $200,000/year USD",Just posted,"Drive the AI-powered learning revolution at 2 Hour Learning - where student success hinges on your ability to engage, empathize, and innovate.
At 2 Hour Learning, we're on a mission to flip the script on traditional education. Our academic ecosystem, powered by cutting-edge AI and learning science, is already enabling students to shatter learning goals in a fraction of the time. But we're just getting started.
You'll be the catalyst that takes our AI-driven products to new heights of engagement and efficacy. This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.
You'll also flex your leadership chops, guiding outsourced dev teams to execute on your vision and quality standards. It's full ownership, full accountability, and full potential to make a seismic impact on education. If you're ready to shape the future of learning, one user insight and AI breakthrough at a time, this is the place for you.

Collaborating with outsourced dev teams to execute on product roadmap and maintain sky-high quality standards
Immersing yourself in learning science and emerging AI tech to fuel a constant cycle of product innovation

What you will NOT be doing
Treating product management as a purely theoretical exercise - you'll be in constant contact with actual students and users
Waiting for lengthy research cycles to guide product decisions - you'll gather insights directly and leverage AI to move fast
Passing the buck on product quality or timeline - you'll have full ownership and accountability for outcomes
Resting on your laurels or settling for incremental improvements - the mandate is to push boundaries and aim for 10x gains

Key Responsibilities
Deliver AI-powered educational products and experiences that demonstrably drive unprecedented student engagement, efficacy, and delight.

Candidate Requirements
At least 5 years of product management experience
