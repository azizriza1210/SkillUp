Samples and genomics information from healthy participants will also be collected and generated by this initiative. All samples and data will be made available to researchers nationally and internationally through BGSi.
The initiative will be organised around a headquarter facility located in Jakarta, housed in the MOH repository building and the historical Eijkman building, that will host the biobank and WGS labs respectively.
