Bank Muamalat,Bank Muamalat visibility public,Posted 30+ days ago,"BMI didirikan atas gagasan dari Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI), Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Indonesia (ICMI) dan pengusaha muslim yang kemudian mendapat dukungan dari Pemerintah Republik Indonesia, sehingga pada 1 Mei 1992 atau 27 Syawal 1412 H, Bank Muamalat Indonesia secara resmi beroperasi sebagai bank yang menjalankan usahanya berdasarkan prinsip syariah pertama di Indonesia. Dua tahun setelahnya, tepatnya pada pada 27 Oktober 1994, BMI memperoleh izin sebagai Bank Devisa setelah setahun sebelumnya terdaftar sebagai perusahaan publik yang tidak listing di Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI).

Selanjutnya, pada 2003, BMI dengan percaya diri melakukan Penawaran Umum Terbatas (PUT) dengan Hak Memesan Efek Terlebih Dahulu (HMETD) sebanyak 5 (lima) kali dan menjadi lembaga perbankan pertama di Indonesia yang mengeluarkan Sukuk Subordinasi Mudharabah. Aksi korporasi tersebut membawa penegasan bagi posisi Bank Muamalat Indonesia di peta industri perbankan Indonesia.

Tak sampai di situ, BMI terus berinovasi dengan mengeluarkan produk-produk keuangan syariah seperti Asuransi Syariah (Asuransi Takaful), Dana Pensiun Lembaga Keuangan Muamalat (DPLK Muamalat) dan multifinance syariah (Al-Ijarah Indonesia Finance) yang seluruhnya menjadi terobosan baru di Indonesia. Selain itu, produk Bank yaitu Shar-e yang diluncurkan pada 2004 juga merupakan tabungan instan pertama di Indonesia. Produk Shar-e Gold Debit Visa yang diluncurkan pada 2011 tersebut memperoleh penghargaan dari Museum Rekor Indonesia (MURI) sebagai Kartu Debit Syariah dengan teknologi chip pertama di Indonesia serta layanan e-channel seperti internet banking, mobile banking, ATM, dan cash management. Seluruh produk-produk itu menjadi pionir produk syariah di Indonesia dan menjadi tonggak sejarah penting di industri perbankan syariah.

Seiring kapasitas Bank yang semakin besar dan diakui, BMI kian melebarkan sayap dengan terus menambah jaringan kantor cabangnya tidak hanya di seluruh Indonesia, akan tetapi juga di luar negeri. Pada 2009, Bank mendapatkan izin untuk membuka kantor cabang di Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia dan menjadi bank pertama di Indonesia serta satu-satunya yang mewujudkan ekspansi bisnis di Malaysia. Hingga saat ini, Bank telah memiliki 249 kantor layanan termasuk 1 (satu) kantor cabang di Malaysia. Operasional Bank juga didukung oleh jaringan layanan yang luas berupa 619 unit ATM Muamalat, 120.000 jaringan ATM Bersama dan ATM Prima serta 55 unit Mobil Kas Keliling.

BMI melakukan rebranding pada logo Bank untuk semakin meningkatkan awareness terhadap image sebagai Bank Syariah Islami, Modern dan Profesional. Bank pun terus merealisasikan berbagai pencapaian serta prestasi yang diakui, baik secara nasional maupun internasional. Kini, dalam memberikan layanan terbaiknya, BMI beroperasi bersama beberapa entitas anaknya yaitu Al-Ijarah Indonesia Finance (ALIF) yang memberikan layanan pembiayaan syariah, DPLK Muamalat yang memberikan layanan dana pensiun melalui Dana Pensiun Lembaga Keuangan, dan Baitulmaal Muamalat yang memberikan layanan untuk menyalurkan dana Zakat, Infak dan Sedekah (ZIS).

BMI tidak pernah berhenti untuk berkembang dan terus bermetamorfosa untuk menjadi entitas yang semakin baik dan meraih pertumbuhan jangka panjang. Dengan strategi bisnis yang terarah, Bank Muamalat Indonesia akan terus melaju mewujudkan visi menjadi “The Best Islamic Bank and Top 10 Bank in Indonesia with Strong Regional Presence”.
