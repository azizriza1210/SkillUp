Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet. Learn more at undp.org or follow at @UNDP
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN’s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life, as envisaged by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are on the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, working with governments and people on their own solutions to global and national development challenges to help empower lives and build resilient nations. The United Nations Development Programme UNDP Indonesia Country Programme 2016-2020 developed in partnership with the Indonesian Government addresses the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals and support national efforts to advance the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
The programme contributes directly to MoH National Action Plan 2015-2019, objective 1) increasing the health status of society and; 2)increasing the responsiveness and protection to society towards social and financial risks related to health and Outcome 2 of the UNDP country Programme for Indonesia (2016-2020), which are aligned with the Indonesian Government Health Sector’s Objectives, commitment to Universal Health Coverage, SDG3 Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages (target 3.8 in particular) and other Sustainable Development Goals. One of its efforts is to be involved in supporting the transformation of health technology in the Ministry of Health through Network Strengthening and the Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative (BGSi).
BGSi is a new initiative of the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH). The initiative will act as a multi-institutional ecosystem that aims to support collaborative biomedical and genomic activities in Indonesia by leveraging strengths in technology and infrastructure including biobanking, data management, high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.
The initiative aims to build a national asset established under the Indonesia Ministry of Health with two major focusses. First, to establish a national biobank focussed on six conditions (diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, psoriasis, and rare/genetic diseases) which will store samples from participants where each sample will be connected to a registry that manages all information associated with the participant (demographic and clinical) and second, to generate Whole Genome Sequence information, for each of those participants, that will be curated in a national database. Samples and genomics information from healthy participants will also be collected and generated by this initiative. All samples and data will be made available to researchers nationally and internationally through BGSi.
The initiative will be organised around a headquarter facility located in Jakarta, housed in the MOH repository building and the historical Eijkman building, that will host the biobank and WGS labs respectively. BGSi HQ will manage the registry system and provide technical support for the Hubs and the entire ecosystem. A second and just as important part of the ecosystem is the hospitals (referred to as HUBs) where each HUB is in charge of managing activities related to recruitment, sample collection and tertiary analysis for the disease it has been assigned.
Therefore, UNDP needs 1 Software Associate who will be responsible to maintain, design, and/or development of systems tailored for existing and upcoming plans, specifically handling participant data (related to demographic, phenotypic, survey, biospecimen, and genomic data) within distinct software environments.
The direct supervisor of this activities is IT System Integration Architect Coordinator for BGSI. She/He will work closely with project team (BGSI, FMTA, and other projects in HEART related to Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative), operations units, and programme staff in the office to provide Technical Assistance and advice regarding biomedical and genome science-related issues and to ensure adequate exchange of information.

Crossover,"Senior Software Engineer, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"The EdTech industry is grappling with the challenge of creating engaging and personalized educational content that can keep students motivated and cater to their individual learning needs. In a market flooded with generic and ineffective learning tools, there's a critical need for differentiation. Studies show that student engagement drops significantly when educational content fails to resonate or adapt to their personal learning journey, leading to a gap in effective education delivery. This leads to an increased workload for teachers, who are expected to deliver high-quality, personalized instruction with limited time and resources.
LearnWith.AI is addressing this challenge head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the creation of educational content. We’re not just building AI tools; we’re developing AI-driven workflows that generate content tailored to the unique needs of students. Imagine being able to design a ""Second Brain"" for subjects like Science or History—a comprehensive, AI-powered repository of domain-specific knowledge that can be harnessed to produce engaging, personalized content at scale. This approach not only sets us apart from competitors but also redefines what’s possible in EdTech, making education more accessible, effective, and enjoyable.
This role isn’t your typical AI engineering position. You won’t just be coding or working on abstract AI models. Instead, you’ll be at the forefront of transforming how students learn by designing and implementing AI-driven workflows that create personalized educational experiences. This is not a job for those who prefer routine tasks or shy away from the challenge of creating a real-world impact. It’s a role for innovators who are passionate about education, thrive on cutting-edge technology, and want to see their work make a tangible difference in students' lives.
As part of our team, you’ll be the architect behind AI-powered educational tools that have the potential to change the landscape of learning. You’ll use LLMs as domain experts to build context packs and second brains, ensuring that our AI produces content that is both relevant and impactful. If you’re excited about the possibility of using AI to reshape education and are ready to take ownership of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, we want to hear from you.

What you will be doing
Designing AI-Driven Workflows: Integrating various AI tools, engineering prompts, and refining workflows based on feedback from subject matter experts and users.
Building Context Packs and Second Brains: Using LLMs as domain experts to develop and maintain documents that encapsulate knowledge and unique organizational insights.

Key Responsibilities

Crossover,"Senior Software Engineer, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements

Crossover,"Full Stack Engineer, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"The EdTech industry is grappling with the challenge of creating engaging and personalized educational content that can keep students motivated and cater to their individual learning needs. In a market flooded with generic and ineffective learning tools, there's a critical need for differentiation. Studies show that student engagement drops significantly when educational content fails to resonate or adapt to their personal learning journey, leading to a gap in effective education delivery. This leads to an increased workload for teachers, who are expected to deliver high-quality, personalized instruction with limited time and resources.
LearnWith.AI is addressing this challenge head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the creation of educational content. We’re not just building AI tools; we’re developing AI-driven workflows that generate content tailored to the unique needs of students. Imagine being able to design a ""Second Brain"" for subjects like Science or History—a comprehensive, AI-powered repository of domain-specific knowledge that can be harnessed to produce engaging, personalized content at scale. This approach not only sets us apart from competitors but also redefines what’s possible in EdTech, making education more accessible, effective, and enjoyable.
This role isn’t your typical AI engineering position. You won’t just be coding or working on abstract AI models. Instead, you’ll be at the forefront of transforming how students learn by designing and implementing AI-driven workflows that create personalized educational experiences. This is not a job for those who prefer routine tasks or shy away from the challenge of creating a real-world impact. It’s a role for innovators who are passionate about education, thrive on cutting-edge technology, and want to see their work make a tangible difference in students' lives.
As part of our team, you’ll be the architect behind AI-powered educational tools that have the potential to change the landscape of learning. You’ll use LLMs as domain experts to build context packs and second brains, ensuring that our AI produces content that is both relevant and impactful. If you’re excited about the possibility of using AI to reshape education and are ready to take ownership of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, we want to hear from you.

What you will be doing
Designing AI-Driven Workflows: Integrating various AI tools, engineering prompts, and refining workflows based on feedback from subject matter experts and users.

Crossover,"Senior Software Engineer, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.

Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements

Vasham Kosa Sejahtera,Software Engineer,Posted 30+ days ago,"Company Description

The story of Vasham started with a pragmatic question: “Why does Indonesia, an agrarian society, annually import billions of dollars worth of staple foods such as soybean, rice, corn and sugar?” Last year 32 million Indonesians lived below the poverty line, struggling to meet their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter; 18 million of these Indonesians were farmers. Last year Indonesia imported US$ 635 million in sugar cane, US$ 425 million in soy and US$ 330 million in corn including numerous other agricultural imports. These statistics alone represent the great systemic failure, and the equally great opportunity for Indonesia to address prevailing poverty and agricultural self-sustainability issues. Vasham is engaged in creating scalable solutions to help. Vasham is a micro financing company that leverages a closed loop business model to provide Indonesian smallholder farmers with the financing, expertise, and income security they need to achieve significantly better standards of living.

Crossover,"Senior AI Engineer, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"The EdTech industry is grappling with the challenge of creating engaging and personalized educational content that can keep students motivated and cater to their individual learning needs. In a market flooded with generic and ineffective learning tools, there's a critical need for differentiation. Studies show that student engagement drops significantly when educational content fails to resonate or adapt to their personal learning journey, leading to a gap in effective education delivery. This leads to an increased workload for teachers, who are expected to deliver high-quality, personalized instruction with limited time and resources.
LearnWith.AI is addressing this challenge head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the creation of educational content. We’re not just building AI tools; we’re developing AI-driven workflows that generate content tailored to the unique needs of students. Imagine being able to design a ""Second Brain"" for subjects like Science or History—a comprehensive, AI-powered repository of domain-specific knowledge that can be harnessed to produce engaging, personalized content at scale. This approach not only sets us apart from competitors but also redefines what’s possible in EdTech, making education more accessible, effective, and enjoyable.
This role isn’t your typical AI engineering position. You won’t just be coding or working on abstract AI models. Instead, you’ll be at the forefront of transforming how students learn by designing and implementing AI-driven workflows that create personalized educational experiences. This is not a job for those who prefer routine tasks or shy away from the challenge of creating a real-world impact. It’s a role for innovators who are passionate about education, thrive on cutting-edge technology, and want to see their work make a tangible difference in students' lives.
As part of our team, you’ll be the architect behind AI-powered educational tools that have the potential to change the landscape of learning. You’ll use LLMs as domain experts to build context packs and second brains, ensuring that our AI produces content that is both relevant and impactful. If you’re excited about the possibility of using AI to reshape education and are ready to take ownership of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, we want to hear from you.

What you will be doing
Designing AI-Driven Workflows: Integrating various AI tools, engineering prompts, and refining workflows based on feedback from subject matter experts and users.
