At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and inspiring stories.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN’s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life, as envisaged by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are on the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, working with governments and people on their own solutions to global and national development challenges to help empower lives and build resilient nations. The United Nations Development Programme UNDP Indonesia Country Programme 2016-2020 developed in partnership with the Indonesian Government addresses the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals and support national efforts to advance the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
The programme contributes directly to MoH National Action Plan 2015-2019, objective 1) increasing the health status of society and; 2)increasing the responsiveness and protection to society towards social and financial risks related to health and Outcome 2 of the UNDP country Programme for Indonesia (2016-2020), which are aligned with the Indonesian Government Health Sector’s Objectives, commitment to Universal Health Coverage, SDG3 Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages (target 3.8 in particular) and other Sustainable Development Goals. One of its efforts is to be involved in supporting the transformation of health technology in the Ministry of Health through Network Strengthening and the Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative (BGSi).
BGSi is a new initiative of the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH). The initiative will act as a multi-institutional ecosystem that aims to support collaborative biomedical and genomic activities in Indonesia by leveraging strengths in technology and infrastructure including biobanking, data management, high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.
The initiative aims to build a national asset established under the Indonesia Ministry of Health with two major focusses. First, to establish a national biobank focussed on six conditions (diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, psoriasis, and rare/genetic diseases) which will store samples from participants where each sample will be connected to a registry that manages all information associated with the participant (demographic and clinical) and second, to generate Whole Genome Sequence information, for each of those participants, that will be curated in a national database. Samples and genomics information from healthy participants will also be collected and generated by this initiative. All samples and data will be made available to researchers nationally and internationally through BGSi.
The initiative will be organised around a headquarter facility located in Jakarta, housed in the MOH repository building and the historical Eijkman building, that will host the biobank and WGS labs respectively. BGSi HQ will manage the registry system and provide technical support for the Hubs and the entire ecosystem. A second and just as important part of the ecosystem is the hospitals (referred to as HUBs) where each HUB is in charge of managing activities related to recruitment, sample collection and tertiary analysis for the disease it has been assigned.
Therefore, UNDP needs 1 Software Associate who will be responsible to maintain, design, and/or development of systems tailored for existing and upcoming plans, specifically handling participant data (related to demographic, phenotypic, survey, biospecimen, and genomic data) within distinct software environments.
The direct supervisor of this activities is IT System Integration Architect Coordinator for BGSI. She/He will work closely with project team (BGSI, FMTA, and other projects in HEART related to Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative), operations units, and programme staff in the office to provide Technical Assistance and advice regarding biomedical and genome science-related issues and to ensure adequate exchange of information.
