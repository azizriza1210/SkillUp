Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet. Learn more at undp.org or follow at @UNDP
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the UN’s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build a better life, as envisaged by 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are on the ground in more than 170 countries and territories, working with governments and people on their own solutions to global and national development challenges to help empower lives and build resilient nations. The United Nations Development Programme UNDP Indonesia Country Programme 2016-2020 developed in partnership with the Indonesian Government addresses the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals and support national efforts to advance the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
The programme contributes directly to MoH National Action Plan 2015-2019, objective 1) increasing the health status of society and; 2)increasing the responsiveness and protection to society towards social and financial risks related to health and Outcome 2 of the UNDP country Programme for Indonesia (2016-2020), which are aligned with the Indonesian Government Health Sector’s Objectives, commitment to Universal Health Coverage, SDG3 Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages (target 3.8 in particular) and other Sustainable Development Goals. One of its efforts is to be involved in supporting the transformation of health technology in the Ministry of Health through Network Strengthening and the Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative (BGSi).
BGSi is a new initiative of the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH). The initiative will act as a multi-institutional ecosystem that aims to support collaborative biomedical and genomic activities in Indonesia by leveraging strengths in technology and infrastructure including biobanking, data management, high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.
The initiative aims to build a national asset established under the Indonesia Ministry of Health with two major focusses. First, to establish a national biobank focussed on six conditions (diabetes, cancer, stroke, tuberculosis, psoriasis, and rare/genetic diseases) which will store samples from participants where each sample will be connected to a registry that manages all information associated with the participant (demographic and clinical) and second, to generate Whole Genome Sequence information, for each of those participants, that will be curated in a national database. Samples and genomics information from healthy participants will also be collected and generated by this initiative. All samples and data will be made available to researchers nationally and internationally through BGSi.
The initiative will be organised around a headquarter facility located in Jakarta, housed in the MOH repository building and the historical Eijkman building, that will host the biobank and WGS labs respectively. BGSi HQ will manage the registry system and provide technical support for the Hubs and the entire ecosystem. A second and just as important part of the ecosystem is the hospitals (referred to as HUBs) where each HUB is in charge of managing activities related to recruitment, sample collection and tertiary analysis for the disease it has been assigned.
Therefore, UNDP needs 1 Software Associate who will be responsible to maintain, design, and/or development of systems tailored for existing and upcoming plans, specifically handling participant data (related to demographic, phenotypic, survey, biospecimen, and genomic data) within distinct software environments.
The direct supervisor of this activities is IT System Integration Architect Coordinator for BGSI. She/He will work closely with project team (BGSI, FMTA, and other projects in HEART related to Bio Informatic Biomedical & Genome Science Initiative), operations units, and programme staff in the office to provide Technical Assistance and advice regarding biomedical and genome science-related issues and to ensure adequate exchange of information.

Crossover,"Senior Software Engineer, LearnwithAI (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"The EdTech industry is grappling with the challenge of creating engaging and personalized educational content that can keep students motivated and cater to their individual learning needs. In a market flooded with generic and ineffective learning tools, there's a critical need for differentiation. Studies show that student engagement drops significantly when educational content fails to resonate or adapt to their personal learning journey, leading to a gap in effective education delivery. This leads to an increased workload for teachers, who are expected to deliver high-quality, personalized instruction with limited time and resources.
LearnWith.AI is addressing this challenge head-on by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize the creation of educational content. We’re not just building AI tools; we’re developing AI-driven workflows that generate content tailored to the unique needs of students. Imagine being able to design a ""Second Brain"" for subjects like Science or History—a comprehensive, AI-powered repository of domain-specific knowledge that can be harnessed to produce engaging, personalized content at scale. This approach not only sets us apart from competitors but also redefines what’s possible in EdTech, making education more accessible, effective, and enjoyable.
This role isn’t your typical AI engineering position. You won’t just be coding or working on abstract AI models. Instead, you’ll be at the forefront of transforming how students learn by designing and implementing AI-driven workflows that create personalized educational experiences. This is not a job for those who prefer routine tasks or shy away from the challenge of creating a real-world impact. It’s a role for innovators who are passionate about education, thrive on cutting-edge technology, and want to see their work make a tangible difference in students' lives.
As part of our team, you’ll be the architect behind AI-powered educational tools that have the potential to change the landscape of learning. You’ll use LLMs as domain experts to build context packs and second brains, ensuring that our AI produces content that is both relevant and impactful. If you’re excited about the possibility of using AI to reshape education and are ready to take ownership of projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible, we want to hear from you.

What you will be doing
Designing AI-Driven Workflows: Integrating various AI tools, engineering prompts, and refining workflows based on feedback from subject matter experts and users.
Building Context Packs and Second Brains: Using LLMs as domain experts to develop and maintain documents that encapsulate knowledge and unique organizational insights.

Key Responsibilities
