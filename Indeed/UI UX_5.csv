Aleph Labs,Aleph Labs visibility public,Posted 30+ days ago,"ALEPH PROFILE:
Hello, we noticed you taking a peek.

It all started on a stormy day in May 2006. There was rain, there was thunder, there was lightning, and there was Aleph.

Aleph is a striking group of craftsmen specialised in strategy, design and technology. We work together to plan, write and produce internet, mobile, and desktop solutions for the most daring set of clients. Bold clients who see the future of user-centric experience and engage Aleph as their rocket fuel.

ALEPH CULTURE:
We’ve grown from a garage operation to a staff strength of 300 and growing across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand; but we still maintain a boutique company feel and culture within each local market. This is what bonds us and yet frees us enough to apply our unique talents, to deliver functional and flexible solutions, to dream big and to make it happen within this part of the world.

First discovered in 2006 the Alephian is a rare species. As a highly collaborative species, the Alephian loves to gather together and exercise great creativity to accomplish large difficult projects for its counter part in the natural hierarchy: “the client”.

The Alephian’s natural habitat is in the mobile and internet space where its nimble fingers and outstanding control of Wacom pens creates beautiful websites, apps, and campaigns.

A peculiar characteristic is the Alephian ability to communicate relevant information consistently. This is highlighted by a Friday morning tradition where they gather around food and exchange knowledge. This appears to be an effort to become a better group of species.

When not at work, Alephians can be found enjoying Southeast Asia’s beautiful resorts and beaches, planning a theme party or cycling together. And if you ever walk by, put your hand up. Alephians love giving high fives.
We are looking for a UI/UX Designer to design software, mobile apps and platforms that meet people’s needs.

Communicate and manage stakeholders' expectations:
Clarify product strategy with product managers, researchers, designers, and engineers to ensure copy accuracy and cohesiveness.
Apply strategic thinking to communicate concepts and ideas to stakeholders in a structured manner to ensure alignment.
Deliver copy according to the agreed timeline.
Collaborate with other roles:

Our Culture

Bank BTPN is the place where our squads can aspire to be the best version of themselves by learning through various roles, and having broader responsibilities during their journey. Empowering our people with a supportive culture and comfortable working environment, has proven to boost our professional and personal growth. Bringing down the barrier between leaders and squad members creates many opportunities to discuss ideas, receive constructive feedback, and find solutions. Bonds between squads is also one of the powerful keys to create impactful collaboration in getting the task done. It helps us create an agile workforce to compete and stay on top in today's banking ecosystem.

Our office set up is designed to stimulate creativity and provide spaces for people to connect easier. You could sometimes find us playing billiards, ranking matches on large TVs', or having a karaoke session after office hours. Yes, we have all the facilities to let our steam out after a long hour of work.

Opting for a community or club activities? We also have an array of exciting and fun internal clubs! Through BTPN Club, our people can choose to join sport clubs like yoga, badminton, and futsal, or even a community club through gaming and parenting club! We believe, through community and club activities, our squad can get the vitamin they need to stay creative and passionate in their daily lives.

Hungry for more knowledge or interested in learning new skills? Aside from the fact that our people can discuss and share ideas with their peers or mentors through conventional or digital means, we also have more than enough classes and courses for self-development and keeping the mind active.

Adaptive to change

Decades of experience has taught us that adapting to changes is necessary to stay on top. Therefore, we embrace the new way of working, where we value the diverse and uniqueness of our squads. Flexible working attire, as well as working location and remote collaboration, has been a part of our policies now. Our way of working, supported by digital collaboration platform, has allowed our squads to be productive while remaining connected, thus able to give the best services to our customers!

Even the ever-changing challenges of the banking industries cannot stop us from moving forward and bring significant changes in the life of millions.
