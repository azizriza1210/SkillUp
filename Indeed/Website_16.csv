At 2 Hour Learning, we're on a mission to flip the script on traditional education. Our academic ecosystem, powered by cutting-edge AI and learning science, is already enabling students to shatter learning goals in a fraction of the time. But we're just getting started.
You'll be the catalyst that takes our AI-driven products to new heights of engagement and efficacy. This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling.

With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.

Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements

WRI Indonesia,Consultant as Hydrologist for Nature-based Solution,Posted 2 days ago,"Program Overview
WRI Indonesia is an independent research organization that turns big ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity, and human well-being. At WRI Indonesia, we aim to bring innovations in research and business approaches in order to create the enabling conditions for Indonesia to achieve robust economic growth while respecting environmental and social values. We seek to contribute to the accomplishment of ambitious sustainable development goals through working with leaders in public and private sectors, as well as collaborating with civil society organizations, in turning big ideas into action.

Within our Agriculture, Forest and Land Use (AFOLU) Program, we envision critical ecosystems such as forests and peatland across Indonesia to be governed fairly and sustainably. We believe sustainable land use management is key for Indonesia to meet its climate goal, in line with keeping the global climate target below the 1.5 degree Celcius warming threshold, while providing sustainable livelihoods to forest-dependent communities and conserve biodiversity in the landscape. We intend to achieve this through safeguarding the remaining forest and peatland from deforestation, degradation, and fragmentation; maintaining forests and peatland quality through sound stewardship; and restoring degraded ecosystem to improve its productivity, conservation value, and ecosystem services.

To achieve Indonesia’s climate goal while at the same time improving the livelihood of the communities and protecting biodiversity, we work together with partners to mainstream nature-based solutions (NbS) as an approach to address global climate challenge. We aim to achieve this through research, policy advocacy, and creation of a community of practice to develop new financing model for forest conservation, advocate regulatory framework that are conducive for NbS approach, and development of multi-stakeholder platform to amplify and accelerate NbS approach in Indonesia and South East Asia region.

WRI Indonesia has joined with 7 other NGOs to form the Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solution (SCeNe) Coalition in recognition of the scale of action required, the time-bound opportunity for impact and the risks to people and nature if we do not act collaboratively to speed up and scale up design and implementation of high-integrity and high-quality NbS. The extensive experience of these environmental NGOs in the development and execution of NbS offers a powerful, shared platform to inform and influence this rapidly growing sector.

The SCeNe Coalition is aimed to develop NbS Tool and Website for Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solution (SCeNe) Coalition. The tool will help to identify high impact future NbS opportunities, ensuring a targeted pipeline of NbS supply that focus on geographies with the highest conservation, social development and carbon potential. This tool will also help to validate triple benefit quality, giving the projects additional scientific credibility; to ensure finance is flowing transparently; and to increase ecosystem participation.

The extensive experience of these environmental NGOs in the development and execution of NbS offers a powerful, shared platform to inform and influence this rapidly growing sector. In the first three years, the Coalition will focus on three inter-connected workstreams that together will scale NbS in the region: i) define the opportunities of where ‘triple benefit’ NbS investment should be made; ii) showcase high-integrity projects to inspire others; and iii) support national and local organizations to access carbon finance and secure funds for conservation.

The SCeNe Coalition is aimed to develop Triple Benefit Tools and Website for Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solution (SCeNe) Coalition. Triple Benefit Tool will help to identify high impact future NbS opportunities, ensuring a targeted pipeline of NbS supply that focus on geographies with the highest conservation, social development and carbon potential.This tool will also help to validate triple benefit quality, giving the projects additional scientific credibility; to ensure finance is flowing transparently; and to increase ecosystem participation.

Crossover,"Full Stack Engineer, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling.

Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:

FAO staff are subject to the authority of the Director-General, who may assign them to any of the activities or offices of the Organization.

Organizational Setting
Over the past three decades, the agricultural landscape in Indonesia, as in other countries across Asia and the Pacific, has undergone significant structural changes resulting in a reduction in the economic share of agriculture. The reliance on women in agriculture has increased due to outmigration of male workers, coupled with a notable rise in the proportion of older farmers in a country that is demographically one of the world's youngest. Despite a growing urbanization trend and internal migration of rural youth in pursuit of educational and employment opportunities, almost 80 percent of the nation's farmers are aged 40 or older. The changing educational profiles of rural youth with a steady reduction in employment in agriculture, highlight the need for addressing declining interest in agricultural careers among the younger population. This trend poses a risk to future food security and necessitates increased youth engagement in addressing challenges related to climate change, disaster resilience, and environmental degradation in Indonesia.
In close collaboration with The Executive Office of the President (KSP) and the National Food Agency (NFA), FAO Indonesia is providing technical assistance through the TCP modality to address the generational gap within the agriculture sector and stimulate the interest of youth in pursuing careers and initiatives related to agriculture as catalysts for change. The primary objective is to develop an agriculture education curriculum for Scouts, enhancing their skills and knowledge through training and establishment of innovative solutions and digital pilot hub.
To increase the effectiveness of the project in engaging the youth, a campaign through digital media will be carried out through independent social media channels under the brand of “Agripreneur Keren” (“Cool Agripreneur”). Many studies show that young people's exposure to modern technology that gives them access to information from around the world can change their perceptions of farmers or the agricultural sector. Social media as part of the digital media platform can effectively empower the youths with information in agriculture and education that are capable of spurring them into agricultural or agro-based activities and provide better agriculture’s image across a broad audience and allow for sharing of information and experiences between the young people especially the young farmers or agripreneurs. Youth engagement through social media also can expand the reach of young people strengthen their network where they can be found online through search engines, communicate with young people in familiar settings and make ideas and opportunities accessible to other youth. The objective of the role is to create the digital space for engaging with the public, civil society, the international community and other relevant stakeholders, in line with the above.

Crossover,"Senior AI Engineer, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.
For more information on 2 Hour Learning, visit our website [https://2hourlearning.com/] and the Future of Education Instagram page [https://www.instagram.com/futureof_education/]. To see a school built around 2 Hour Learning, check out Alpha [https://alpha.school/].

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements
At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.
Hands-on experience integrating large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, or similar into web applications.
Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.

This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.
You'll also flex your leadership chops, guiding outsourced dev teams to execute on your vision and quality standards. It's full ownership, full accountability, and full potential to make a seismic impact on education.

Waiting for lengthy research cycles to guide product decisions - you'll gather insights directly and leverage AI to move fast
Passing the buck on product quality or timeline - you'll have full ownership and accountability for outcomes
Resting on your laurels or settling for incremental improvements - the mandate is to push boundaries and aim for 10x gains

Key Responsibilities
Deliver AI-powered educational products and experiences that demonstrably drive unprecedented student engagement, efficacy, and delight.

Crossover,"Artificial Intelligence Engineer, 2 Hour Learning (Remote) - $100,000/year USD",Just posted,"Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.
At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.
Your Role in the Revolution:
In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.
This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.
Who We're Looking For:
We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What you will be doing
Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What you will NOT be doing
Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Candidate Requirements
