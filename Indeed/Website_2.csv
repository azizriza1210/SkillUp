At 2 Hour Learning, we're on a mission to flip the script on traditional education. Our academic ecosystem, powered by cutting-edge AI and learning science, is already enabling students to shatter learning goals in a fraction of the time. But we're just getting started.
You'll be the catalyst that takes our AI-driven products to new heights of engagement and efficacy. This role is for educational visionaries ready to roll up their sleeves and get into the trenches with students and staff. You'll engage with users constantly, gathering raw insights to inform each product iteration. No hiding behind focus groups or third-party reports - you'll build trust and rapport directly with the students whose lives your products will transform.
But gathering intel is just the start. You'll feed those insights into a non-stop cycle of AI-powered innovation. From generating new features with ChatGPT to automating marketing tasks to maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base, you'll wield AI as your copilot to bring products to life at light speed.
You'll also flex your leadership chops, guiding outsourced dev teams to execute on your vision and quality standards. It's full ownership, full accountability, and full potential to make a seismic impact on education.
