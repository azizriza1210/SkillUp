The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

 Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery
 Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery
 Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups

In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and Gender Equality, Disability and Social Inclusion (GEDSI).

 Program Background 

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:

 Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery 
 Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery 
 Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups 


SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara (Kaltara), Tanah Papua.
