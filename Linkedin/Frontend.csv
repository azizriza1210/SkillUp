We are now a 400 person mobile games studio, headquartered in London, with offices in Warsaw, Barcelona, Minsk, Jakarta and Melbourne.
The Financial Times awarded Tripledot the Fastest Growing Business in Europe in 2022
Tripledot won Tech Growth Business of the Year 2021 and 2023
PocketGamer just awarded us Best Mobile Developer 2023
The Kings Award for International Enterprise 2024

Working at Tripledot Studios Indonesia
Located in Central Jakarta, our Tripledot Studios Indonesia office is well located for an easy commute and with plenty to do in the local area.

The award-winning team here has a 14-year presence in the Indonesian games industry, with some of the best talent found in Indonesia. Our team consists of the most experienced and skilled game experts in Southeast Asia. We believe in mixing work with a good dose of fun, our office is a place where everyone can feel at home. We love playing games, jamming on the guitar and the occasional Karaoke night!

Just a fun fact, Jakarta is one of the world's most populous, and fastest-growing metropolitan area. The city is the economic and financial hub of Indonesia, major centre for finance, commerce, trade, and attracting businesses and investors from around the world. As the result of that, Jakarta is a very friendly city for expatriates to live. They have formed communities to help one another to adjust for living in Jakarta.

Due to its location, Jakarta is an ideal spot for taking weekend trips. If you have a car — which may be a worthwhile investment considering the difficulties of public transportation — you can simply drive out of the city and head to a nice secluded beach or hike along the rice paddies and visit one of the numerous temples scattered throughout Indonesia. Famous cities and countries like Bali, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand are only 3 hours away flight time from Jakarta!
