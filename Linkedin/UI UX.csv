弊社はグローバルでトップクラスのコンサルティング実績を誇り、最大規模のプロフェッショナル・ネットワークと歴史を誇る、Deloitte Consultingの東南アジアプラクティスです。
東南アジアに長い歴史を有し、現地でのあらゆる経営課題の解決に必要な知見、ケイパビリティを培っています。
  ■ 本ポジションの概要
本ポジションは、東南アジアにおける日本企業向けのエンタープライズテクノロジー＆パフォーマンス部門 - テクノロジーストラテジー・トランスフォーメーションユニット (JCS-ETP-TST) におけるマネジャークラスの募集です。
  ■ 東南アジア (ASEAN 10ヶ国) 全域をフィールドに活躍できます
Deloitte Consulting Southeast Asia (SEA) は、東南アジア全体を一つのプラクティスとして運営する体制を構築しています。これにより域内複数国にまたがるプロジェクトをスピーディーかつシームレスに実行したり、域内全ての拠点からベストなメンバーでプロジェクトチームを組成することが出来ます。クライアントの多くは複数国で事業を展開しているため、クライアントのニーズにより応えやすいプラットフォームです。
 
■ 総合コンサルティングファームとして地域最大級の規模を活かすことができます
Deloitte Consulting SEAは地域最大級の総合コンサルティングファームであり、戦略・オペレーション・DX・人事・テクノロジーなど幅広いテーマをカバーしています。またJapanese Client Servicesはこの中の重要な一部であり、日本企業にフォーカスしているプラクティスとして域内最大級の規模、プレゼンスを有しています。大規模かつ複合的な経営課題にも構想から実現まで一気通貫でサポートが可能です。一人ひとりの強みとチームとしての総合力でクライアントの経営課題の解決を支援しています。
 
■ グローバル人材として成長できる環境を得ることができます
東南アジア各国はもちろんそれ以外の地域の出身者も多数在籍しており、多様なバックグラウンドを有するメンバーと働くことができます。また、東南アジアで長年コンサルティングを経験しているメンバーが多数いるため、豊富な経験や知見を吸収することが可能です。日本経済・社会・企業文化に関する理解を強みとしながら、同時にグローバル 人材として成長することができる、またとない環境と自負しています。
 少子高齢化に代表される社会構造の長期的な変化により、日本企業にとって海外事業の拡大・成功は重要な経営課題です。成長市場であり文化・距離的にも日本と比較的に近い東南アジア市場は獲得が必須の市場といっても過言ではありません。
 一方で、東南アジアは巨大な経済圏でありながら、一つ一つの国が異なる性質を持つという多様性に富んだ地域でもあります。こうした多様性は東南アジアに進出する日本企業のビジネスをより複雑なものにしています。また、日本企業にとって競合となる現地企業や海外企業の競争力も日増しに高まっています。
Deloitte Consulting SEAでは日本企業の東南アジアにおける成功を一緒に支えていただける方を求めています。
  ■ 本ポジションの生まれた背景
人口7億人に迫る一大経済圏である東南アジアにおいて、近年日本企業の投資意欲が益々高まっております。
東南アジアに進出する日本企業のビジネスが成長・多様化するなかで、テクノロジーを用いた変革の相談が増えており、当部門は過去3年間継続して順調な成長を続けています。特にCOVID－19以降、グローバルで一気通貫のマネジメントや、マネジメントの透明性を高めるプロジェクトのご依頼が非常に増えています。テーマは様々ありますが、共通点として
  可視化
ガバナンスの強化
在庫やSCM情報の整備
データドリブンな経営意思決定
 などは頻繁に飛び交うテーマとなっており、これらのいずれか単一の場合もあればこれらを複合的に扱うこともあります。
 テクノロジーストラテジー・トランスフォーメーション (TS&T) ユニットでは『企業の経営課題にテクノロジー/デジタルの知見を持って相対し、そのトランスフォーメーションを共に推進・支援することで更なる企業価値創出に貢献する』を組織のミッションに掲げ、年々複雑化・高度化するクライアントの経営課題の解決に寄与致します。
 また、Deloitte Consultingの強みである「経営戦略コンサルタント」として長年培ったストラテジー起点のノウハウを活かし、経営戦略レベルでの計画立案から企画・構想策定、トランスフォーメーションの推進およびグロースのための伴走と、幅広いテーマに対応しています。

東南アジアでは、テーマが日本より先行して始まることが多く、新会社設立や、事業部を作り替える、などのテーマを扱うこともあります。弊社ではこうしたテーマにおいてもテクノロジーも含めた一気通貫での対応力を評価いただいており、今後さらに機会が増えていくことが予想されている状況で、本ポジションを積極的に採用するに至りました。

Working at Tripledot Studios Indonesia
Located in Central Jakarta, our Tripledot Studios Indonesia office is well located for an easy commute and with plenty to do in the local area.

The award-winning team here has a 14-year presence in the Indonesian games industry, with some of the best talent found in Indonesia. Our team consists of the most experienced and skilled game experts in Southeast Asia. We believe in mixing work with a good dose of fun, our office is a place where everyone can feel at home. We love playing games, jamming on the guitar and the occasional Karaoke night!

Just a fun fact, Jakarta is one of the world's most populous, and fastest-growing metropolitan area. The city is the economic and financial hub of Indonesia, major centre for finance, commerce, trade, and attracting businesses and investors from around the world. As the result of that, Jakarta is a very friendly city for expatriates to live. They have formed communities to help one another to adjust for living in Jakarta.

Due to its location, Jakarta is an ideal spot for taking weekend trips. If you have a car — which may be a worthwhile investment considering the difficulties of public transportation — you can simply drive out of the city and head to a nice secluded beach or hike along the rice paddies and visit one of the numerous temples scattered throughout Indonesia. Famous cities and countries like Bali, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand are only 3 hours away flight time from Jakarta!
Tripledot Studios will provide some relocation benefits including the VISA, relocation allowances, flight tickets, a month apartment rent, and some other things!

Deloitte Consulting,Manager - Technology Strategy & Transformation - Japanese Client Services (JCS-TST),Reposted 5 months ago,"■ Deloitte Consulting SEAについて
弊社はグローバルでトップクラスのコンサルティング実績を誇り、最大規模のプロフェッショナル・ネットワークと歴史を誇る、Deloitte Consultingの東南アジアプラクティスです。
東南アジアに長い歴史を有し、現地でのあらゆる経営課題の解決に必要な知見、ケイパビリティを培っています。
  ■ 本ポジションの概要
本ポジションは、東南アジアにおける日本企業向けのエンタープライズテクノロジー＆パフォーマンス部門 - テクノロジーストラテジー・トランスフォーメーションユニット (JCS-ETP-TST) におけるマネジャークラスの募集です。
  ■ 東南アジア (ASEAN 10ヶ国) 全域をフィールドに活躍できます
Deloitte Consulting Southeast Asia (SEA) は、東南アジア全体を一つのプラクティスとして運営する体制を構築しています。これにより域内複数国にまたがるプロジェクトをスピーディーかつシームレスに実行したり、域内全ての拠点からベストなメンバーでプロジェクトチームを組成することが出来ます。クライアントの多くは複数国で事業を展開しているため、クライアントのニーズにより応えやすいプラットフォームです。
 
■ 総合コンサルティングファームとして地域最大級の規模を活かすことができます
Deloitte Consulting SEAは地域最大級の総合コンサルティングファームであり、戦略・オペレーション・DX・人事・テクノロジーなど幅広いテーマをカバーしています。またJapanese Client Servicesはこの中の重要な一部であり、日本企業にフォーカスしているプラクティスとして域内最大級の規模、プレゼンスを有しています。大規模かつ複合的な経営課題にも構想から実現まで一気通貫でサポートが可能です。一人ひとりの強みとチームとしての総合力でクライアントの経営課題の解決を支援しています。
 
■ グローバル人材として成長できる環境を得ることができます
東南アジア各国はもちろんそれ以外の地域の出身者も多数在籍しており、多様なバックグラウンドを有するメンバーと働くことができます。また、東南アジアで長年コンサルティングを経験しているメンバーが多数いるため、豊富な経験や知見を吸収することが可能です。日本経済・社会・企業文化に関する理解を強みとしながら、同時にグローバル 人材として成長することができる、またとない環境と自負しています。
 少子高齢化に代表される社会構造の長期的な変化により、日本企業にとって海外事業の拡大・成功は重要な経営課題です。成長市場であり文化・距離的にも日本と比較的に近い東南アジア市場は獲得が必須の市場といっても過言ではありません。
 一方で、東南アジアは巨大な経済圏でありながら、一つ一つの国が異なる性質を持つという多様性に富んだ地域でもあります。こうした多様性は東南アジアに進出する日本企業のビジネスをより複雑なものにしています。また、日本企業にとって競合となる現地企業や海外企業の競争力も日増しに高まっています。
Deloitte Consulting SEAでは日本企業の東南アジアにおける成功を一緒に支えていただける方を求めています。
  ■ 本ポジションの生まれた背景
人口7億人に迫る一大経済圏である東南アジアにおいて、近年日本企業の投資意欲が益々高まっております。
東南アジアに進出する日本企業のビジネスが成長・多様化するなかで、テクノロジーを用いた変革の相談が増えており、当部門は過去3年間継続して順調な成長を続けています。特にCOVID－19以降、グローバルで一気通貫のマネジメントや、マネジメントの透明性を高めるプロジェクトのご依頼が非常に増えています。テーマは様々ありますが、共通点として
  可視化
ガバナンスの強化
在庫やSCM情報の整備
データドリブンな経営意思決定
 などは頻繁に飛び交うテーマとなっており、これらのいずれか単一の場合もあればこれらを複合的に扱うこともあります。
 テクノロジーストラテジー・トランスフォーメーション (TS&T) ユニットでは『企業の経営課題にテクノロジー/デジタルの知見を持って相対し、そのトランスフォーメーションを共に推進・支援することで更なる企業価値創出に貢献する』を組織のミッションに掲げ、年々複雑化・高度化するクライアントの経営課題の解決に寄与致します。
 また、Deloitte Consultingの強みである「経営戦略コンサルタント」として長年培ったストラテジー起点のノウハウを活かし、経営戦略レベルでの計画立案から企画・構想策定、トランスフォーメーションの推進およびグロースのための伴走と、幅広いテーマに対応しています。

東南アジアでは、テーマが日本より先行して始まることが多く、新会社設立や、事業部を作り替える、などのテーマを扱うこともあります。弊社ではこうしたテーマにおいてもテクノロジーも含めた一気通貫での対応力を評価いただいており、今後さらに機会が増えていくことが予想されている状況で、本ポジションを積極的に採用するに至りました。
  ■ プロジェクトテーマ

   ServiceNow & Enterprise Experience領域

  ■ Technology Strategy & Transformationユニットの特徴
TS&Tのコンサルタントは、単独だけではなく社内の色々なチームとコラボレーションしながらプロジェクトを進めています。

Amazon Web Services (AWS),Customer Delivery Architect - AWS Professional Services,Reposted 2 weeks ago,"Description

The Amazon Web Services Professional Services (AWS ProServe) ASEAN organization is looking for experienced Customer Delivery Architects (CDAs). A CDA is responsible for partnering with ProServe leaders and client partners to dive deep into a customer’s business challenge in order to collaboratively propose and pre-qualify a particular set of business outcomes that would result from a formal ProServe engagement. Thereafter, the CDA remains meaningfully engaged with that customer, Amazon team and project/program to ensure high-value, predictable, and successful delivery.

AWS ProServe engage in a wide variety of projects for customers and partners, providing collective AWS customer experience, best practices, and obsessing about strong success for the Customer. Our team collaborates across the entire AWS organization to bring access to product, service, and training teams, to deliver the right solutions and drive feature innovations for our customers across all industries.
