Goodwork,Web Designer 🖌️💻🧘🏾‍♂️ (Mental Health | WordPress | Remote),5 days ago,"Goodwork is recruiting for a US-based mental health marketing, web design, and coaching agency.

What makes this opportunity interesting?
🇺🇸 Join a growing American company shaping the future of therapy practices
🌱 Design to positively impact users’ mental health
🎓Work under the mentorship of a design veteran with nearly 30 years of experience

About the Company
We're a mental health marketing, web design, and coaching agency offering a mix of ""done with you"" and ""done for you"" services to help psychotherapists attract their dream clients and grow their businesses. Our mission: to improve our collective mental health by providing a clear, sustainable path for clinicians to support more people and make the world a better place.

We offer two primary service lines: à la carte web design and our flagship “$300K Practice Program”, a comprehensive 12-month journey that combines expert marketing coaching, high-converting website design, and ongoing marketing support. It starts with a hybrid of online courses and weekly group coaching calls, teaching therapists to identify their dream clients and write converting copy. This collaborative process typically takes 4-6 months to design and build a high-converting website. Once live, we manage Google Ads, SEO, and other marketing aspects for the remainder of the year. 

Our other marketing services include website design, SEO research, content creation, directory listings, social media support, and comprehensive reporting for therapists who prefer a hands-off approach. Throughout both offerings, we emphasize authentic, therapist-written content to build trust with potential clients.

Our customers are primarily solo mental health practitioners and occasionally small group practices (2-5 therapists) across the United States. Our clients trust us with their deepest professional aspirations, and we take pride in helping them achieve success.
With 18 years of industry experience, we've worked with hundreds of therapists, continuously refining our approach. We're currently experiencing explosive growth, on track to triple or quadruple our revenue from 2023. Our founder has been designing and coding websites since 1996, and brings a wealth of industry knowledge. His unique background includes starring in a National Geographic TV show, and extensive remote work experience across 44 countries, bringing a unique perspective to our global, distributed team.

OUR COMPANY VALUES guide our team and shape our culture: 
🏆 Expertise: We're all experts in what we do, continuously honing our skills.
🙌 Ownership: You are the owner of your work, empowered to make decisions and drive results.
📚 Growth Mindset: We are lifelong learners, always seeking to improve and innovate.
🌍 Impact: We make the world a better place by supporting mental health professionals.
🏝️ Freedom: Creative digital minds need liberation - remote work is key to our success.

We're a fully remote organization with 3 core team members (soon to be 4 👋🏾), including our founder, two SEO specialists, and various freelancers. We're headquartered in Santa Cruz, California, but our team spans across the globe.

Our culture is fast-paced yet flexible, with a strong emphasis on independent work and self-management. We're small and growing, actively shaping our company culture. We communicate primarily through Slack and Zoom, fostering an environment where every team member has a voice. We believe in autonomy and efficiency, avoiding micromanagement as long as results are being produced. Our team enjoys ample support, regular check-ins, and time for continuing education to grow their skills through YouTube videos, articles, and self-guided learning.

About the Role
We’re looking for a remote Web Designer to craft visually stunning, conversion-focused websites for mental health professionals using WordPress and Elementor. You'll lead our web design process, creating 2-3 new sites monthly, maintaining 20+ active sites, and designing new pages for SEO and blogs. Your tasks will include:
Creating website mockups in Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, etc
Developing brand identities
Producing high-fidelity designs with custom illustrations
Collaborating on design-to-development handoffs
Continuously improving our design process. 
Occasional creation of social media graphics, logos, and print materials.

You'll apply CRO, behavioral design, and UX principles to build high-converting websites that balance aesthetic appeal with functionality. Your designs will feature fluid layouts, strong colors, and whimsical elements that resonate with our clients' brands.

This role offers the opportunity to design for mental health, focusing on evoking calm emotional states through thoughtful design. Your work will not only be visually appealing but also resonate with the emotional needs of our clients' audiences, creating a supportive online presence.

Our IDEAL CANDIDATE brings 3-5 years of experience in web design, specializing in landing pages and responsive designs for service-based businesses. You're proficient in Adobe Creative Suite or Figma, and have experience designing – and ideally implementing your designs – for WordPress and/or Elementor. You understand conversion rate optimization (CRO), user experience (UX), and behavioral design principles, seamlessly integrating calls-to-action and psychological triggers into your designs. 

Your design style is feminine, flowing, and life-affirming, resonating with mental health practices. You incorporate strong colors and whimsical elements without relying heavily on block-based layouts, creating custom illustrations and graphics that evoke emotions aligning with our clients' brands. The ability to code your designs in WordPress/Elementor, translating your vision into functional websites, is a significant plus. 

You're highly responsive to feedback, thrive in a fast-paced remote environment, and continuously adapt your skills to the mental health sector. As an excellent communicator with a growth mindset, you're passionate about making a positive impact in mental health. Your values align with our company culture, and you're excited about the potential to shape the future of therapy practices through design.

Where required, hands-on application configuration to meet customer needs.
Direct and mentor diverse teams, such as customers, partners, and colleagues in technical delivery aspects, as well as non-technical topics such as communication strategies or executive influence.
Fuel our internal growth by identifying, leading or contributing to internal pivotal initiatives, such as innovations, building up a strategic brand, and nurture teammates' skills by sharing knowledge.
Where required, support pre-sales activities to position Salesforce Services.
Contribute to broader goals by becoming a citizen philanthropist and give back to our communities by joining or leading volunteering activities.

Required Qualifications

Hands-on technical consulting and solution implementation experience for a major software domain (e.g. CRM, ERP, HR) as well as coding experience in object oriented languages.
Ability to analyze, design, and optimize business processes via technology and integration.
Experience in guiding customers and project members in rationalising and deploying emerging technology for business use cases.
Work independently and as part of a distributed team and a willingness to take ownership of problems.
Rapidly learn new technologies as well as strong presentation, communication and facilitation skills.
Available to travel regionally and occasionally internationally depending on customer needs.
Experience will be evaluated based on alignment to the core competencies for the role (e.g. extracurricular leadership roles, military experience, volunteer work, etc.).

Preferred Qualifications

A detailed understanding of Web Services, Data Modeling, and Enterprise application integration concepts, including experience with enterprise integration tools (ESBs and/or ETL tools), and common integration design patterns with enterprise systems (e.g. CMS, ERP, HRIS, DWH/DM).
Ability to build and maintain key relationships with C-level / mid level and key decision makers.
Experience as a Senior Architect and/or CTO in a mid to large sized organisation with leadership driving an organisational transformation in a matrixed organisation.
