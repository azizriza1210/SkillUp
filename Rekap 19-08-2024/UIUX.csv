In addition, he/she demonstrates strong interpersonal, prioritization, and stakeholder management skills in collaborating with product team, engineers, interaction designers, visual designers and various other roles. Not only that he/she is collaborative, the Copywriter brings empathy to the foreground of our efforts by understanding how a user is feeling and what their needs are while interacting with our products.

To obtain optimal product fit and quality, he/she is able to work on multiple tasks concurrently and deliver on expectations within deadlines, with high level of changes and iterations required. In addition, he/she demonstrates stakeholder management skills in partnering with internal stakeholders to develop high quality creative solutions that meet overall business objectives and goals.

What makes this opportunity interesting?
üá∫üá∏ Join a growing American company shaping the future of therapy practices
üå± Design to positively impact users‚Äô mental health
üéìWork under the mentorship of a design veteran with nearly 30 years of experience

About the Company
We're a mental health marketing, web design, and coaching agency offering a mix of ""done with you"" and ""done for you"" services to help psychotherapists attract their dream clients and grow their businesses. Our mission: to improve our collective mental health by providing a clear, sustainable path for clinicians to support more people and make the world a better place.

We offer two primary service lines: √† la carte web design and our flagship ‚Äú$300K Practice Program‚Äù, a comprehensive 12-month journey that combines expert marketing coaching, high-converting website design, and ongoing marketing support. It starts with a hybrid of online courses and weekly group coaching calls, teaching therapists to identify their dream clients and write converting copy. This collaborative process typically takes 4-6 months to design and build a high-converting website. Once live, we manage Google Ads, SEO, and other marketing aspects for the remainder of the year. 

Our other marketing services include website design, SEO research, content creation, directory listings, social media support, and comprehensive reporting for therapists who prefer a hands-off approach. Throughout both offerings, we emphasize authentic, therapist-written content to build trust with potential clients.

Our customers are primarily solo mental health practitioners and occasionally small group practices (2-5 therapists) across the United States. Our clients trust us with their deepest professional aspirations, and we take pride in helping them achieve success.
With 18 years of industry experience, we've worked with hundreds of therapists, continuously refining our approach. We're currently experiencing explosive growth, on track to triple or quadruple our revenue from 2023. Our founder has been designing and coding websites since 1996, and brings a wealth of industry knowledge. His unique background includes starring in a National Geographic TV show, and extensive remote work experience across 44 countries, bringing a unique perspective to our global, distributed team.

OUR COMPANY VALUES guide our team and shape our culture: 
üèÜ Expertise: We're all experts in what we do, continuously honing our skills.
üôå Ownership: You are the owner of your work, empowered to make decisions and drive results.
üìö Growth Mindset: We are lifelong learners, always seeking to improve and innovate.
üåç Impact: We make the world a better place by supporting mental health professionals.
üèùÔ∏è Freedom: Creative digital minds need liberation - remote work is key to our success.

We're a fully remote organization with 3 core team members (soon to be 4 üëãüèæ), including our founder, two SEO specialists, and various freelancers. We're headquartered in Santa Cruz, California, but our team spans across the globe.

Our culture is fast-paced yet flexible, with a strong emphasis on independent work and self-management. We're small and growing, actively shaping our company culture. We communicate primarily through Slack and Zoom, fostering an environment where every team member has a voice. We believe in autonomy and efficiency, avoiding micromanagement as long as results are being produced. Our team enjoys ample support, regular check-ins, and time for continuing education to grow their skills through YouTube videos, articles, and self-guided learning.

About the Role
We‚Äôre looking for a remote Web Designer to craft visually stunning, conversion-focused websites for mental health professionals using WordPress and Elementor.

Occasional creation of social media graphics, logos, and print materials.

You'll apply CRO, behavioral design, and UX principles to build high-converting websites that balance aesthetic appeal with functionality. Your designs will feature fluid layouts, strong colors, and whimsical elements that resonate with our clients' brands.

This role offers the opportunity to design for mental health, focusing on evoking calm emotional states through thoughtful design. Your work will not only be visually appealing but also resonate with the emotional needs of our clients' audiences, creating a supportive online presence.

Our IDEAL CANDIDATE brings 3-5 years of experience in web design, specializing in landing pages and responsive designs for service-based businesses. You're proficient in Adobe Creative Suite or Figma, and have experience designing ‚Äì and ideally implementing your designs ‚Äì for WordPress and/or Elementor. You understand conversion rate optimization (CRO), user experience (UX), and behavioral design principles, seamlessly integrating calls-to-action and psychological triggers into your designs. 

Your design style is feminine, flowing, and life-affirming, resonating with mental health practices. You incorporate strong colors and whimsical elements without relying heavily on block-based layouts, creating custom illustrations and graphics that evoke emotions aligning with our clients' brands. The ability to code your designs in WordPress/Elementor, translating your vision into functional websites, is a significant plus. 

You're highly responsive to feedback, thrive in a fast-paced remote environment, and continuously adapt your skills to the mental health sector. As an excellent communicator with a growth mindset, you're passionate about making a positive impact in mental health. Your values align with our company culture, and you're excited about the potential to shape the future of therapy practices through design.

Your performance will be measured by the number of completed websites per month, client satisfaction, turnaround time, and ability to hit the mark with initial designs. We value high-quality output, flexibility in moving between projects, and responsiveness to feedback.
While not a client-facing position, you'll collaborate closely with our SEO Specialists and Developers. This position reports directly to the CEO.
