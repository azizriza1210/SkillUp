Description

Who are we?

Tripledot Studios is a 500 person mobile games studio, recently recognised by the Financial Times as ""The Fastest Growing Company in Europe"", and even more recently won ""Best Developer Award"" at Pocket Gamer 2023!

We are a record breaking, chart-topping mobile games studio that is currently leading in the Casual mobile gaming space.

Our guiding principle as a team is that when people love what they do, what they do will be loved by others. The studio is filled with people who love taking things apart and figuring out how they work. We enjoy problem-solving and most importantly, we LOVE making games!

Working at Tripledot Studios Indonesia

Located in Central Jakarta, our Tripledot Studios Indonesia office is well located for an easy commute and with plenty to do in the local area.

The award-winning team here has a 14-year presence in the Indonesian games industry, with some of the best talent found in Indonesia. Our team consists of the most experienced and skilled game experts in Southeast Asia. We believe in mixing work with a good dose of fun, our office is a place where everyone can feel at home. We love playing games, jamming on the guitar and the occasional Karaoke night!

Just a fun fact, Jakarta is one of the world's most populous, and fastest-growing metropolitan area. The city is the economic and financial hub of Indonesia, major centre for finance, commerce, trade, and attracting businesses and investors from around the world. As the result of that, Jakarta is a very friendly city for expatriates to live. They have formed communities to help one another to adjust for living in Jakarta.

Due to its location, Jakarta is an ideal spot for taking weekend trips. If you have a car — which may be a worthwhile investment considering the difficulties of public transportation — you can simply drive out of the city and head to a nice secluded beach or hike along the rice paddies and visit one of the numerous temples scattered throughout Indonesia. Famous cities and countries like Bali, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand are only 3 hours away flight time from Jakarta!

Tripledot Studios will provide some relocation benefits including the VISA, relocation allowances, flight tickets, a month apartment rent, and some other things!

It’s our job to ensure that our Transport services run seamlessly from the inside out.

Our team recently figured out that our existing third-party SDK for in-app live tracking of vehicles was not operating as smoothly as we had expected. So, guess what?
