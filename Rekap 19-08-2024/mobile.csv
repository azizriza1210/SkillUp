We process payments, power marketplaces, disburse payroll and loans, provide KYC solutions, prevent fraud, and help businesses grow exponentially. We serve our customers by providing a suite of world-class APIs, eCommerce platform integrations, and easy to use applications for individual entrepreneurs, SMEs, and enterprises alike.

Our main focus is building the most advanced payment rails for Southeast Asia, with a clear goal in mind — to make payments across and within SEA simple, secure and easy for everyone. We serve thousands of businesses ranging from SMEs to multinational enterprises, and process millions of transactions monthly. We’ve been growing rapidly since our inception in 2015, onboarding hundreds of new customers every month, and backed by global top-10 VCs. We’re proud to be featured on among the fastest growing companies by Y-Combinator.

The Role
You will be hired as a Junior or Mid Product Designer - Mobile as part of the Nex (Experiment) team.

The Experiments Team
The Experiments team builds new products under Nex, Xendit’s Consumer team, that are complementary to our existing suite of digital infrastructure. We take ideas, customer pain points, or gaps in the market and build a new solution from the ground up. This team presents a unique opportunity for people who are looking to build something completely new, rather than improving existing products.

As the name suggests, these products are experimental, meaning they sometimes fail. We’re therefore looking for people who can quickly recognize failure, take feedback, and iterate immediately, even if it means leaving behind our previous dreams of what the product could look like.

This is an opportunity for design generalists to apply their skills in solving problems for multiple segments and work on products to drive the company’s growth. 

Outcomes
These are some of the activities that you will be involved/assisting in: 
High Fidelity design solutions with a focus on merchant or customer experience 
Conduct stakeholder interviews and customer research to identify problems and their root causes, as well as areas for improvement
Engage with customers to test and validate solutions
Map user journeys for various personas across products and platforms to create a seamless solution
Collaborate with PMs, developers, designers, and other stakeholders to align on product strategy and limitations to design the best merchant experience
Do whatever it takes to make Nex succeed

What we’re looking for
You may be a good fit if you:
Have 2+ years of experience in a product design role designing mobile applications
Have worked on the Design System
Have a good understanding of design and usability principles
Can create designs with challenging constraints (tech and business)
Is proficient in using Figma for product design, Design System, and prototyping
Can switch between working independently and being a team player
Design with critical thinking: Create solutions with a hypothesis-driven problem solving mindset that seeks to validate desirability, usability, and other assumptions by conducting research / testing
Have prior experience or keen interest in user research, engaging and observing customers to understand their needs, pain points, and summarising these into actionable insights
Have deep interest in technical products and service design
Have experience or keen interest in facilitating workshops and cross-functional brainstorming sessions
Are highly adaptable and able to deal with ambiguities and an unstructured work environment - we are growing fast, breaking things and constantly iterating
Speed to good quality output: Able to put together low-fi sketches, mid-fidelity wireframes to high fidelity mockups for review, within a reasonable timeframe
Communicate well across teams

Bonus points if you have:
Worked in the Financial Services sector or understand how payments work
Prior experience designing mobile products
A background or educational qualifications in Human-Centred Design, Computer Science
Worked for a high-growth start-up before

We look for people who demonstrate our values:
Solve for the customer first: You build what customers want. You think about what is right for customers, not what is easiest for you
Demonstrate mastery of honey badgery: You make ambitious goals. Then execute…no matter what stands in the way. When knocked down, you get up
Take on challenges willingly and can be trusted to execute: You can be trusted to get things done right the first time quickly. You hit your deadlines
You’re like us: You smile a lot, think work is fun and don’t take yourself too seriously. You measure yourself against the best and believe feedback is the breakfast of champions. You follow the golden rule

Who are we?

Tripledot Studios is a 500 person mobile games studio, recently recognised by the Financial Times as ""The Fastest Growing Company in Europe"", and even more recently won ""Best Developer Award"" at Pocket Gamer 2023!

We are a record breaking, chart-topping mobile games studio that is currently leading in the Casual mobile gaming space.

Our guiding principle as a team is that when people love what they do, what they do will be loved by others. The studio is filled with people who love taking things apart and figuring out how they work. We enjoy problem-solving and most importantly, we LOVE making games!

Working at Tripledot Studios Indonesia

Located in Central Jakarta, our Tripledot Studios Indonesia office is well located for an easy commute and with plenty to do in the local area.

Our team consists of the most experienced and skilled game experts in Southeast Asia. We believe in mixing work with a good dose of fun, our office is a place where everyone can feel at home.

Just a fun fact, Jakarta is one of the world's most populous, and fastest-growing metropolitan area. The city is the economic and financial hub of Indonesia, major centre for finance, commerce, trade, and attracting businesses and investors from around the world. As the result of that, Jakarta is a very friendly city for expatriates to live. They have formed communities to help one another to adjust for living in Jakarta.

Due to its location, Jakarta is an ideal spot for taking weekend trips. If you have a car — which may be a worthwhile investment considering the difficulties of public transportation — you can simply drive out of the city and head to a nice secluded beach or hike along the rice paddies and visit one of the numerous temples scattered throughout Indonesia. Famous cities and countries like Bali, Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand are only 3 hours away flight time from Jakarta!
